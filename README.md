  "message": "Hi there! I recently purchased your Lavender Bliss Soap and wanted to share some feedback. Unfortunately, the product I received didn’t quite meet expectations. The scent was very chemical-like instead of lavender, and it caused some dryness and irritation on my skin. Additionally, it didn’t lather well and left a bit of a residue. I’m sure this isn’t the standard your company aims for, so I wanted to let you know in case there’s a QC miss that needs attention. I truly enjoy supporting your brand and hope this feedback helps improve your products. Thank you for your time!",

  "message": "What on earth is this garbage you’re selling?! I bought your so-called '\''Lavender Bliss Soap'\'' and it’s an absolute joke. It smells like a toxic waste dump, not lavender! Not only that, but it ruined my skin—dry, itchy, and red patches everywhere! And don’t even get me started on how it doesn’t lather; it’s like rubbing a candle on my body. This is the worst product I’ve ever used, and I can’t believe I wasted my money on this trash. If you don’t give me a full refund right now, I’m never buying from your pathetic shop again, and I’ll make sure everyone I know avoids you too!",
